* Floortech Object Library for ArchiCAD (GDL)

The Floortech library consists of around 10 parameterized objects that simplify the drawing process for a Floortech Construction Drawing.
The objects are typically drawn in 2D but do have 3D representations.

The library objects work in tandem with the Floortech ArchiCAD Template meaning any changes to the objects must either retain all linked paramters or update the template to suit changes.
